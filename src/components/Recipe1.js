        <p>
          Even though the name may indicate otherwise, the German Chocolate Cake
          actually has Southern roots dating back to the 1950s. The classic cake
          is defined by its decadent Coconut-Pecan Frosting. Just make sure to
          let the cake layers cool completely before lathering on the frosting.
